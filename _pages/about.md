I am currently an Associate Researcher at Southeast University in Nanjing, China. Prior to this role, I worked shortly as a specially appointed Assistant Professor at Osaka University. I got my Ph.D. in cryptography from Kyoto University, Japan, under the supervision of Mehdi Tibouchi and Masayuki Abe. Before pursuing my studies in Japan, I completed my bachelor's degree at Peking University.
